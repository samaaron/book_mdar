# RSpec

When using stubs with RSpec you can roughly categorise the methods you are going to use into two categories. On one side you have the sub! and should_receive methods which refine what methods you expect to be called with what parameters and potentially what they should return in the case of the test being run. On the other side you have assertions which test the output and value or variables. The should method is primarily used when asserting things.
