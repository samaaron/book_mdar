# Preface

At New Bamboo we've been building our internal applications in Merb for quite some time now. This is a collaborative effort to document the features of Merb and DataMapper, while also providing an example Merb application.  

___Who is this for?___

The target reader is someone who has some experience with writing Ruby on Rails applications, and is looking to try out a new framework. So if your looking for the [AWDR](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails2) equivalent for Merb, you may be disappointed as not all topics will be covered.
